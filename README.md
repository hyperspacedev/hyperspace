Hyperspace is the fluffiest client for Mastodon and other fediverse networks written in TypeScript and React. Hyperspace offers a fun, clean, fast, and responsive design that scales beautifully across devices and enhances the fediverse experience.

> Note: For more information on how Hyperspace 1.0 is different from the *Hyperspace Classic (0.x)* series, please see [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md).

## Build instrictions

### Prerequisites

To develop Hyperspace, you'll need the following tools and packages:

- Node.js 8 or later
- (Optional) Visual Studio Code

### Installing dependencies

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperspacedev/hyperspace
```

Then, in the app directory, run the following command to install all of the package dependencies:

```npm
npm install
```

### Testing changes

Before testing Hyperspace, make the following change in `config.json`, located in the public directory:

```json
    "location": "https://localhost:3000"
```

This is necessary to test Hyperspace locally and will need to be reverted after testing or before releasing to `master`.

To run a development version of Hyperspace, either run the `start` task from VS Code or run the following in the terminal:

```npm
npm start
```

The site will be hosted at `https://localhost:3000`, where you can sign in and test Hyperspace using your Mastodon account. If you have signed in before, you will be automatically logged in.

### Building a release

To build a release, run the following command:

```npm
npm build
```

The built files will be available under `build` as static files. These files should get hosted to a web server.

#### Building desktop releases

You can run any of the following commands to build a release for the desktop:

- `build-desktop`: Builds the desktop apps for all platforms (eg. Windows, macOS, Linux). Will run `npm run build` before building.
- `build-desktop-win`: Builds the desktop app for Windows without running `npm run build`.
- `build-desktop-darwin`: Builds the desktop apps for macOS (eg. disk image, Mac App Store) without running `npm run build`.
- `build-desktop-linux`: Builds the desktop apps for Linux (eg. Debian package, AppImage, and Snap) without running `npm run build`.
- `build-desktop-linux-select`: Builds the desktop app for Linux without running `npm run build`. _Target is required as a parameter._

> Note: If you are building the macOS version of Hyperspace, add your provisioning profiles and entitlements files in the `desktop` folder and ensure you have installed your developer certificates on your machine before running `build-desktop` or `build-desktop-darwin`.
>
> While the command will run without needing the signature, it is recommended that you make a signed copy to protect users.

The built files will be available under `dist` that can be uploaded to your app distributor or website.
